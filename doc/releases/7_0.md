# GitLab Cloud Native Chart 7.0

Along with the `16.0` release of GitLab, we have bumped the chart version to `7.0`.

## Summary of major changes

## Upgrade path from 6.x

In order to upgrade to the `7.0` version of the chart, you first need to upgrade to the latest `6.11.x`
release of the chart. Check the [version mapping details](../installation/version_mappings.md) for the latest patch.

GitLab now defaults to using two database connections. Prior to upgrading, you can check that PostgreSQL `max_connections` is
high enough (using more than 50% of the available max connections).
You can verify this by running the following Rake task using [the Toolbox container](../charts/gitlab/toolbox/index.md#toolbox-included-tools):

```shell
gitlab-rake gitlab:db:decomposition:connection_status
```

If the task indicates that `max_connections` is high enough, then you can
proceed with the upgrade. If not, or you wish to remain on single
connection, you can set the `ci.enabled` key to `false` prior to the upgrade.
